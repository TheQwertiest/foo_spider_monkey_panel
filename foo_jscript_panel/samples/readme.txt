REQUIREMENTS:
Although the component has been updated to run on any version of Windows supported by foobar2000 itself,
some scripts have their own.

samples\basic
=============

All these should work fine on any system.

samples\complete
================

All these scripts should work on any system with IE8 or later installed. 

There are three exceptions:

"Listenbrainz" requires any version of Windows with IE9 or later installed. It also works under WINE
following the guide on the github wiki.

"Thumbs" can display existing images on any system but requires Windows with at least
IE9 to download new ones. Downloading does not work on XP/WINE.

"Last.fm Lover" doesn't work on XP/WINE. Requires any version of Windows with IE9 or later.

The FontAwesome font is required.

samples\jsplaylist-mod, samples\js-smooth
=========================================

These scripts should work fine on any system. The following fonts are required:

"Guifx v2 Transports.ttf" http://blog.guifx.com/2009/04/02/guifx-v2-transport-font/
"wingdings2.ttf"
"wingdings3.ttf"

If you have Microsoft Office installed, you should have the wingdings fonts. If not, you'll have to
search for them.

USAGE:
Simply copy the text from any .txt file inside the various folders in to a panel's configuration dialog.

IMPORTANT:
Remember that any future component installation will overwrite all files in this directory
so store new files/edits elsewhere.
