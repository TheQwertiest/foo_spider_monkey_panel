This is a component for the [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) audio player.

It allows to use JavaScript to create full-fledged CUI/DUI panels!  

Base functionality includes:
- Graphics functions: drawing (text, images, lines, rectangles and etc), image modification (resize, blur, inversion of colours and etc).
- Access to font and colour settings from CUI/DUI preferences.
- Capture of foobar2000 events with callbacks.
- Capture of keystrokes and mouse movement/clicks.
- Execution of main menu and context menu commands.
- Creation of custom buttons and menus.
- Playlist management: create, destroy, sort, change, rename and do anything that fb2k can do.
- Media Library access with ability to sort and filter it's content.
- File tag management.
- Per panel settings storage. 
- Built-in web and filesystem functionality.
- [foo_acfu](https://acfu.3dyd.com) integration.
- And more!

## Information for JScript Panel users

<details><summary markdown='span'>\>\>Click\<\<</summary>

The main difference from the excellent `JScript Panel` component by [marc2003](https://github.com/marc2k3) is the underlying JavaScript engine:
- `foo_jscript_panel` uses closed-source `JScript` engine from Internet Explorer, which was abandoned by Microsoft after the development of IE Edge.
- `foo_spider_monkey_panel` uses open-source `SpiderMonkey` engine from Mozilla Firefox, which is being actively developed and improved every day!

Main features of `Mozilla SpiderMonkey` engine:
- ECMAScript 2019 conformant JavaScript.
- Potential support of ECMAScript Next once it has been released.
- Blazing-fast performance!
- Easily customizable: allows to implement a lot of features that couldn't be implemented before.

Or just use the [Migration Guide](faq/jsp_to_smp_migration_guide.md) to make your scripts compatible.
